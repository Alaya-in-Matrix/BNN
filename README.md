Bayesian optimization through Bayeisan neural network and Thompson sampling

Possible models:

- SVI with reparameterization trick
- MCMC with SGD
- Dropout
- Neural process
- [Variational continual learning](https://github.com/nvcuong/variational-continual-learning/blob/master/ddm/alg/vcl.py)
    - See citations of the original paper
    - Jordan: Streaming Variational Bayes

## Papers to Read

- [Yes, but Did It Work?: Evaluating Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02538.pdf)

## Possible Ideas

- Variational continual learning + PSIS diagnostic
- HMC + Importance sampling
- Kaiming and Xavier prior
